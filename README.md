# InvokeAI Batch Img2Img Processor

Since there is no official support (yet?) to run a bunch of images in batch against a generation i made this.  
It is very specific to my workflow and what i want it to do.  

Everything is explained somewhere ether in the code or in the GUI.    
Contributions are welcome if they make sense.  

There are 2 examples in `workflows/` i personally use. It just does some light reimagination of the image. See the Demo Video.

## Demo Video

This just shows what i do with this by using a random example video.
